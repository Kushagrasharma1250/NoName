# 📋 Product & Requirements Document
## AI-Enabled Geospatial System for Industrial Fire & Persistent Thermal Source Monitoring

**Version:** 1.1  
**Date:** 23 August 2026  
**Project Type:** AI + GIS + Remote Sensing  
**Primary Objective:** Automatically identify, classify, and monitor industrial fires and persistent thermal sources using satellite thermal anomalies, land-cover information, industrial infrastructure data, and satellite imagery.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Industrial facilities such as oil refineries, petrochemical complexes, thermal power plants, steel industries, mining areas, and LNG terminals produce thermal signatures that can be detected from space. Accidental industrial fires, gas leaks, explosions, abnormal flaring, and other thermal events can create serious risks to infrastructure, public safety, and the environment.

Existing satellite fire-monitoring systems such as NASA FIRMS provide valuable thermal anomaly detections, but a thermal anomaly by itself does not reveal whether the source is an industrial fire, gas flare, agricultural burning, mining activity, or wildfire.

This project proposes an **AI-enabled geospatial intelligence platform** that combines:

- Satellite thermal anomaly data
- INSAT near-real-time data for India and NASA FIRMS/VIIRS near-real-time data for global coverage
- Satellite optical imagery
- Land-cover information
- Industrial infrastructure databases
- Historical thermal-event information
- Spatial and temporal features
- Machine-learning classification
- User authentication and role-based access
- Nearest fire-station lookup and consent-based SMS alerts
- Grounded natural-language data insights

The system will classify detected thermal events, estimate confidence and risk, store results in a spatial database, and visualize them through an interactive GIS dashboard.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Current satellite-based fire-monitoring systems can detect thermal anomalies, but they generally do not provide sufficient contextual classification of the source.

A detected thermal hotspot could represent:

- Industrial fire
- Gas flare
- Oil/refinery thermal activity
- Thermal power plant activity
- Mining-related thermal activity
- Agricultural burning
- Forest/wildfire
- Other persistent or unexplained thermal sources

This creates a significant information gap for authorities, industries, environmental agencies, and emergency-response organizations.

The proposed system addresses this gap by combining thermal observations with geographic, industrial, land-cover, satellite-image, and historical information to automatically classify and monitor thermal events.

---

# 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed platform will operate as a multi-source AI and GIS pipeline.

# 26. Final Product Definition

The proposed product is an **AI-enabled geospatial monitoring and decision-support platform** that detects satellite thermal anomalies and determines their likely source using thermal characteristics, industrial infrastructure, land cover, satellite imagery, and historical behavior.

The final system should answer five critical questions:

1. **Where is the thermal anomaly?**
2. **What is it likely to be?**
3. **Is it associated with an industrial facility?**
4. **Is it persistent or abnormal?**
5. **How significant is the event?**

The combination of **AI + Remote Sensing + GIS + Temporal Analytics + Spatial Databases** forms the core of the proposed solution.
